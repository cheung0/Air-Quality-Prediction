# Predicting Air Quality
## Summary
1. Air quality is better in warmer months, compared to colder months.
2. Air quality gets better, the further you go from downtown LA. I gave each data point an additional point of information, distance as measured by the haversine formula. There’s a moderate negative correlation with distance from central LA and AQI value of -0.31.
3. Lancaster air quality is worst than expected.
4. Air quality is good on most days, with the exception of a few days, such as wildfires.
5. Machine learning models trained with linear regression, decision tree, and transformer predict AQI (air quality index) fairly well with PM2.5, month, and distance from central LA as features. Linear regression has an R2 score of 0.94, decision tree with 0.99, and transformer with 0.99.
