# Predicting-Air-Quality
## Intro

Actually more like analyzing air quality, since the weather forecast is lot better than my model. Nontheless, I still wanted to play with Machine Learning. We all have fundamental needs, such as food, water, love, and clean air. Practical takeaway from my findings if you live in the Bay Area like I do: air quality is better on weekends. Therefore, you might want to open your windows for fresh air on Saturdays and Sundays. 

## How I did it
I analyzed 1678 data samples from air quality sensor data around the Bay Area during 2023. Some factors that play a role in air quality include: traffic, industrial activity, and environmental factors. For Alameda County specifically, the average AQI for weekends was 23 and the average for weekdays 23.6. My sample size wasn't big enough, so I analyzed again with data from all the Bay Area. The average AQI for weekends was 22.38 and the average for weekdays 23.15. A 0.6 vs a 0.77 difference. Again, a small difference appears, but if you use this knowledge and apply it over the span of thousands of days, it can make a big difference in your health and well being.

## Conclusion

The small, individual actions of each and every single one of us can cause big, large actions in the environment. I acknowledge that I might be wrong about the increased traffic on weekdays and analysis and my data from the US EPA gov website does attach a disclaimer that some data may be inaccurate and should not be used for governmental advisory.
