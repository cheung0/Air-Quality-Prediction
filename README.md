# Predicting-Air-Quality
## Intro

We all have fundamental needs, such as food, water, love, and clean air. Practical takeaway from my findings if you live in the Bay Area like I do: air quality is better on weekends. Therefore, you might want to open your windows for fresh air on Saturdays and Sundays. 
Note: It's actually more like analyzing air quality, since the weather forecast is lot better than my model. Nontheless, I still wanted to play with Machine Learning.

## How I did it
I analyzed 1678 data samples from air quality sensor data around the Bay Area during 2023. Some factors that play a role in air quality include: traffic, industrial activity, and environmental factors. For Alameda County specifically, the average AQI for weekends was 23 (0 - 50 is a good AQI) and the average for weekdays 23.6. My sample size wasn't big enough, so I analyzed again with data from all the Bay Area. The average AQI for weekends was 22.38 and the average for weekdays 23.15. A 0.6 and a 0.77 difference. Then I looked at the data for PM 2.5 Î¼g/m3 levels. I noticed that weekends were slightly higher, by 0.16, on avgerage. Again, a small difference appears, but if you use this knowledge and apply it over the span of thousands of days, it can make a big difference in your health and well being.

## Conclusion

The small, individual actions of each and every single one of us can cause big, large actions in the environment. I acknowledge that I might be wrong about the increased traffic on weekdays and analysis and my data from the US EPA gov website does attach a disclaimer that some data may be inaccurate and should not be used for governmental advisory.
