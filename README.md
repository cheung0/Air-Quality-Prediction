# Predicting-Air-Quality
## Intro

We all have fundamental needs, such as food, water, love, and clean air. Practical takeaway from my findings if you live in the Bay Area like I do: air quality is better on weekends. Therefore, you might want to open your windows for fresh air on Saturdays and Sundays. Another takeway is that the opposite is true when you factor in 128,000 data points from around California. I'm not entirely sure why that is so far.

## Analysis for the Bay Area
I analyzed 1678 data samples from air quality sensor data around the Bay Area during 2023. Some factors that play a role in air quality include: traffic, industrial activity, and environmental factors. For Alameda County specifically, the average AQI for weekends was 23 (0 - 50 is a good AQI) and the average for weekdays 23.6. My sample size wasn't big enough, so I analyzed again with data from all the Bay Area. The average AQI for weekends was 22.38 and the average for weekdays 23.15. A 0.6 and a 0.77 difference. Then I looked at the data for PM 2.5 Î¼g/m3 levels. I noticed that weekends were slightly higher, by 0.16, on avgerage. Again, a small difference appears, but if you use this knowledge and apply it over the span of thousands of days, it can make a big difference in your health and well being.

## Analysis for California
I analyzed 128,077 data samples from air quality sensor data around California during 2023. I found out that the average AQI for weekdays was 34.07 and for weekends 34.84. I also found out that the difference in air quality between weekends and weekdays to be statistically significant. Meaning there is a noticeable difference in air quality between weekends and weekdays.

## Conclusion

The small, individual actions of each and every single one of us can cause big, large actions in the environment. I acknowledge that I might be wrong about the increased traffic on weekdays and analysis and my data from the US EPA gov website does attach a disclaimer that some data may be inaccurate and should not be used for governmental advisory.
